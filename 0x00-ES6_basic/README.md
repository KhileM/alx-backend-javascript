ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features and syntax enhancements to JavaScript. Some ES6 basics include:

let and const: Declarations for variables using let and const that offer block-scoping and immutability respectively.
Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing functions using =>, providing more straightforward function definitions.
Template Literals: Strings enclosed in backticks (``) allowing interpolation of variables and expressions.
Enhanced Object Literals: Shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods.
Destructuring: Extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables using a syntax like [a, b] = [1, 2] or { x, y } = { x: 1, y: 2 }.
Spread and Rest Operators: The spread (...) operator spreads elements of an iterable (like an array) while the rest parameter collects multiple elements into an array.
Classes: A more convenient syntax for creating constructor functions and prototypes, making it easier to work with objects and inheritance.
Promises: A standardized way of handling asynchronous operations, allowing better control over callbacks and avoiding callback hell.
Modules: A system for organizing and structuring code into smaller, reusable files, promoting better code organization and maintainability.

These features significantly enhanced JavaScript's readability, efficiency, and capabilities, making ES6 widely adopted among developers.
