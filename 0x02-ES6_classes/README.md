ES6 classes refer to the class syntax introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to create objects in JavaScript. They provide a more structured and intuitive way to define and create objects and their behavior, resembling class-based languages like Java or C++. Here's a brief overview:

Syntax: Classes in ES6 follow a structured syntax using the class keyword to define a blueprint for creating objects. They contain constructors and methods within their bodies.

Constructor: The constructor() method initializes class properties when an object is instantiated using the new keyword. It's called automatically upon object creation.

Methods: Other methods within the class define behaviors or actions associated with objects created from that class. These methods can be accessed by objects created from the class.

Inheritance: ES6 classes support inheritance through the extends keyword, allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another class (the superclass).
