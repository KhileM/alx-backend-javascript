Backend JavaScript refers to the use of JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling the creation and management of server applications. Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily associated with frontend development, running in web browsers to create interactive user experiences. However, with the introduction of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript became capable of executing on servers as well.

Node.js, a runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine, allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, enabling the creation of server-side applications. It provides access to various modules and libraries, facilitating tasks such as handling HTTP requests, interacting with databases, managing file systems, and more.

Backend JavaScript leverages the non-blocking, event-driven nature of JavaScript, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests. It allows developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both frontend and backend development, promoting code reuse and reducing the gap between frontend and backend teams.

Developers use frameworks like Express.js, NestJS, and Hapi to streamline the process of building server-side applications using JavaScript. These frameworks provide essential tools, middleware, and patterns to handle routing, middleware integration, error handling, and more, making backend development more organized and efficient.

Backend JavaScript has gained popularity due to its flexibility, performance, and the ability to create isomorphic applications where the same code can run on both the client and the server, improving the overall user experience and code maintainability.
