ES6 introduced Promises as a way to handle asynchronous operations more cleanly and efficiently compared to traditional callback-based approaches. Promises represent a proxy for a value that will be available in the future, allowing you to write code that executes when that value becomes available, whether it's a successful result or an error.

Key concepts of ES6 Promises:

Asynchronous Operations: Promises are used to manage operations that take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file.

States: A Promise can be in one of three states: pending (initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected), fulfilled (meaning the operation completed successfully), or rejected (meaning the operation failed).

Chaining: Promises allow chaining multiple asynchronous operations together using .then() to handle successful outcomes and .catch() to manage errors.

ES6 Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code, making it easier to manage asynchronous tasks, avoid callback nesting (known as "callback hell"), and improve code readability and maintainability.
